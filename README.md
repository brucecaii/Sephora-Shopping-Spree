# Sephora-Shopping-Spree (SSS)

A scrappy script that helps your wife or girl friend buy makeups from Sephora during the promotion sale and sufficiently increase the happiness of your love relationship.

Sephora Canada has two big sales during the year, and they will make a specific promo code valid at a random time during the mid-night. Wives and girl friends have to either stay all night or wake up early to purchase the makeups, especially those limited quantitied ones, before they are out of stock. It is very often that they wake up at 5am and still can't either validate the code or the makeups are out of stock. This program login your account automatically and start checking if the promo code is valid. When it is valid, it prompts a window to tell you so you don't need to manually check and validate the promo code status.
