# sephora-sale-for-your-wife

A scrappy script that helps your wife buy makeups from Sephora during the promotion sale and sufficiently increase the happiness of your marriage.

Sephora Canada has two times sale during the year, and they will make a specific promotion code valid at a random time during the mid-night. This program login your account automatically and start checking if the promo code is valid. When it is valid, it prompts a window to tell you so you don't need to manually check and validate the promo code status.
